# Snake Game 🐍🎮

A simple Snake Game built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
I originally created it as a fun project for my nephew, but it turned into a nice way to practice game logic, canvas drawing, and event handling in JavaScript.

## Features
- Smooth snake movement with arrow keys
- Random food placement
- Score tracking
- Game over alert with sound effects
- Increasing speed as the snake grows

## How to Play
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Use the arrow keys to move the snake.
3. Eat the red food to grow and increase your score.
4. Avoid hitting the walls or yourself.  

Enjoy playing! 🚀
